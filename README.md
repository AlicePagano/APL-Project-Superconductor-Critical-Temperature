##Â Measurement of the critical temperature of a superconductor via resistance measurements

Superconductivity is a phenomenon occurring in certain materials that display exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields when cooled below a charac- teristic critical temperature Tc. It is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon whose special physical properties have attracted the attention of many physicists and electric engineers since its discovery by Onnes in 1911. In this Report, we discuss the realization of an experimental apparatus for the estimation of the critical temperature of an unknown ceramic cuprate superconductor sample by measuring the drop in electrical resistance.

## Folder Organization

This project is organized in multiple directories as:

* Analysis: this folder contains the jupyter notebook for performing the analysis and the data

* Utils: this folder contains useful pdf and tables for performing the analysis and build the experimental setup

* Paper: this folder contains the latex report

* Experimental Notes: notes taken for preparing the experimental setup
